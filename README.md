This application is the result of a semester of work (among other courses of course) in my 2nd year at the INSA Toulouse. I then paired with anther student, Marc Prom√©, who helped me setting up the game mechanics.

### What can I find here? ###

* The source code of the project as presented for evaluation, barely modified since nearly 3 years. It is certainly buggy, but for what it's worth, it is a multiplatform, multilingual (once translated :p), evolutive hack'n'slash type game.

### What can I find elsewhere? ###

* You can have a somewhat more detailed description of the project on my personal website here : http://remi-saurel.com/projects/games/2nd_year_project/en

Thank you!
